# Customer Segmentation Project Using SQL

A practical project analyzing customer purchase patterns from sales data using SQL. Demonstrates how businesses can segment customers—such as high-value, repeat, and occasional shoppers—through structured query analysis.

## Description

- Explores customer purchase behaviors to enable targeted segmentation.
- Uses SQL to classify customers into key segments for retention and marketing insights.
- Focuses on leveraging SQL queries for real-world customer analytics.

## Learnings

- Used JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS) to merge sales and customer data tables.
- Wrote aggregation queries to analyze purchase volumes and frequency.
- Applied CASE statements to categorize customers into specific segments.
- Calculated moving averages and tracked revenue trends over time.
- Practiced query optimization techniques to efficiently process large datasets.

## SQL Techniques Used

- `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` for combining sales and customer records.
- `GROUP BY` and `COUNT()` to measure purchase frequency and segment size.
- `CASE WHEN` clauses to automate segmentation logic.
- `ORDER BY` to rank customers by total purchases.
